// DO THE THING 1
// PSEUDO CODE
// Have a bunch of strings in an array
// Iterate through the array of strings to see which has longest length
// If string is the longest then store that into a variable
// Keep looping until checks all the strings of the array
// Case if more than one string is the longest and same length?
