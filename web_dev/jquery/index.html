	<h1>Hello this is Tim's Practice Page!</h1>
	<h3>Here you can find not much about anything other than random text.</h3>
		<p>Tim is a person that is determined to become a web developer. He is working very hard. There are just so many things to understand and read. Simply coding and getting the job done is too far less than a job well done is for Tim</p>
	<article>
		<h4>Tim is just another ordinary guy getting by with life</h4>
		<p>Tim is no more special than any other person. He simply does and hopes for the best. Expects nothing in return. And lives life purposefully until maybe one day he will become something more significant.</p>
