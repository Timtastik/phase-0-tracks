## What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
* Linux never assumes that the user is incompetent. It always assumes you know what you are doing and allows you do do anything you tell it to. Anything.
* Linux has several fine GUI(Graphical User Interfance) desktop environments from which to choose so that every user can choose the one he or she likes best.
* Konsole - terminal emulator for GUI desktop - allows multiple terminal sessions using tabs to switch between terminal sessions. There is also a screen program that allows multiple terminal sessions within a single terminal session
* Linux users have complete control of commands, because Linux does not handhold. It allows you to run a command without asking if you are sure to run that command. There is great power with this means great danger.
* "TREAT ALL USERS WITH RESPECT"
* Linux is for the developers, more than anyone else.
* The entire Linux kernel was written from scratch, without employing any code from proprietary sources.
* The Linux software is generally released as a distribution, which is a set of pre-packaged software making up an entire system.
* Open Source is a term that applies to software for which the source code--the inner workings of the program--is freely available for anyone to download, modify, and redistribute.

##In your own words, what is a VPS(virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
* A virtual private server is technically a computer with its own operating system within the internet. It has its own operating system.
* VPS hosting gives a user complete control over your server and also the same benefits of the pricey dedicated server.
* Think of a VPS, such as a condo unit to a build, while Shared hosting is like an apartment to a building. In a VPS, you own your part and have your own resources. You own your own share of the server.
* VPS has to make their own repairs and modifications since it is not shared.
